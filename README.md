# Data collection: 
The data was collected through surveys using the Cantril ladder scale. The first report was published in 
2012 and covered the period up to 2016. These reports were then utilized to generate the 2017 Happiness 
rankings for 155 countries, which were released on March 20th to celebrate the International Day of 
Happiness. The World Happiness Report has been collecting data annually, with the most recent data 
available in the 2019 report.

#Data contents: 
The data on happiness scores and rankings is collected through the Gallup World Poll, using the Cantril 
ladder question as a measure of life evaluation. The scores are based on nationally representative samples 
from 2013-2016 and are weighted to ensure representativeness. Additional factors indicate how different 
countries perform in relation to Dystopia and help explain the variations in rankings.

#Data Bias:
The cantril ladder question can be interpreted differently among individuals, which can be due to cultural 
bias in different countries. There can be sampling bias, the samples may not fully capture the diversity and 
characteristics of the entire population in each country. Certain demographic groups or regions may be 
underrepresented or overrepresented, leading to a skewed representation of happiness levels

#Hypothesis:
Countries with higher levels of economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity are more likely to have higher happiness scores and rankings.

#Key Questions: 
1.Is there a correlation between the happiness score and GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, corruption, and generosity? How strong is this correlation?
2. How does the distribution of Happiness Scores vary across different continents or regions?
3.Which country has the highest and lowest average Happiness Score across all years?
4.What is the overall trend of Happiness Score across the years?
5.Are there any countries that consistently ranked in the top 5 in terms of Happiness Score throughout the years?
